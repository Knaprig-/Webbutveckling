					<h2>Battleships - AS3 project</h2>
					<img src="Images/battleShips.png">
					<p>This was a project where I in Action Script 3 (a programming language) had to recreate the game Battleships. This version is single player only, and you simply try to get a high score by finding all of the randomly placed ships as soon as possible. The game tracks your hits, misses and number of different ship types you've sunk. When the ships are placed at the start of the game, they can't be placed directly next to each other. Knowing this, the game is not fully random as you can rule out some positions of the ships.</p>

					<h2>Development of Södra Älvstranden</h2>
					<img src="Images/roadWork.png">
					<p>This is a model of a potential future look for the area called Södra Älvstranden in Gothenburg. The area right now is really innefficient in terms of public transportation.</p>
